            You told your friends you werenâ€™t bringing your phone, to try and
            experience what travel was like back in the day. You bought a map
            and a bottle of water and carried your camera for the money shot.
            But the map was from 2005 and the landscape had changed. So here you
            are, in the middle of a large field, that the map continues to claim
            is a local grocer.
